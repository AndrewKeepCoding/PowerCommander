When the computer is powered on again, it can quickly resume from the hibernated state, restoring everything to exactly where it was. Disabling hibernation can potentially improve system performance by reclaiming storage space on the hard disk that would otherwise be occupied by the hibernation file (hiberfil.sys). This file is typically as large as the amount of RAM installed in the system. If your device has ample RAM and you don't frequently use hibernation, disabling it might free up valuable storage and reduce the write activity on your storage device.",
